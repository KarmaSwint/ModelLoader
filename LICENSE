TL;DR for the legally challenged:

1. This software is freer than a bird with a jetpack. Use it, abuse it, hell, send it postcards from exotic locations.

2. If you redistribute this bad boy, keep this license intact. It's like a digital tramp stamp - always there, slightly embarrassing, but necessary.

3. We're not responsible for any shit that hits the fan when you use this. If it deletes your hard drive, sets your computer on fire, or becomes sentient and tries to date your sister, that's on you, buddy.

4. No takesies backsies on this license. Once it's out there, it's out there like that embarrassing photo from your college days.

Remember, I'm not a lawyer, and this summary is about as legally binding as a pinky promise. But it's honest work.
