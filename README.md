CivitAI Model Downloader for ComfyUI
====================================

Welcome to the most awesome, humor-laden ComfyUI model downloader this side of the internet!

What in the world is this?
--------------------------
This CLI tool is like a digital assistant for your ComfyUI setup. It sweet-talks the CivitAI API, downloads models faster than you can say "Holy moly!", and tucks them neatly into your ComfyUI directory. It's so easy, even your grandma could use it (but please don't show her, the jokes might confuse her).

Features (or why this tool is awesome):
---------------------------------------
1. Searches CivitAI like a bloodhound on a mission
2. Downloads models faster than you can question your life choices
3. Sorts and filters results, because we're not savages
4. Automatically unzips files, saving you precious seconds of your life
5. Comes with more Easter eggs than a rabbit's dream
6. Uses colors in the terminal, because we're fancy like that

1. Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git)
2. Install the requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Run main.py (python main.py)
4. Follow the on-screen prompts like they're the most important instructions ever
